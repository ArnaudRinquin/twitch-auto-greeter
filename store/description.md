Twitch Auto-Greeter

## Short Description (132 characters max)
Automatically send greetings in Twitch chat to be counted as an active viewer. Language-aware, customizable, privacy-focused.

## Detailed Description

Twitch recently changed how it counts spectators - only viewers who participate in chat are counted as active. Twitch Auto-Greeter ensures you're always counted by automatically sending a greeting message when you join a stream.

### Key Features

✨ **Smart Greeting System**
- Automatically sends one greeting per stream (default: 24-hour cooldown)
- Natural 10-15 second delay after joining to appear human
- Only greets once per visit - no spam

🌍 **Language-Aware Messaging**
- Auto-detects stream language tags
- Sends appropriate greetings in English, French, Spanish, German, Portuguese, Japanese, and more
- 40+ default messages across 7 languages included

🎨 **Fully Customizable**
- Create your own greeting messages with `<streamer>` placeholder
- Configure messages for specific streamers or use globally
- Preview messages with Twitch and BetterTTV emote rendering
- Filter and organize your messages by streamer and language

🎯 **Powerful Controls**
- Whitelist: Only auto-greet specific streamers
- Blacklist: Disable for certain streamers
- Adjustable frequency: Change the cooldown period
- Custom delay timing: Set your preferred wait time

📊 **Greeting History**
- View when you last greeted each streamer
- See the exact message that was sent
- Clear history per streamer or all at once

🔒 **Privacy-Focused**
- All data stored locally on your device
- No external servers or tracking
- No data collection or sharing
- Open source on GitHub

### How It Works

The extension uses a smart cascading message selection:

1. **Streamer-specific messages** are prioritized - if you've configured messages for a specific streamer, those are used exclusively
2. **Language-specific messages** are next - the extension detects stream language tags and sends appropriate greetings
3. **Global messages** as fallback - language-agnostic messages work on any stream

### Perfect For

- Viewers who want to support their favorite streamers by being counted
- Multi-language viewers who watch streams in different languages
- Anyone who wants consistent chat participation without manual effort
- Privacy-conscious users who want local-only data storage

### Open Source

This extension is fully open source and available on GitHub. Contributions and feedback welcome!
